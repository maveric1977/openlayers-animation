** DONE TimedLayer interface
   - defined interface for setting current time for layer
** NOPE TimedLayerWrapper
   CLOSED: [2014-03-13 Thu 17:26]
   - wraps an existing layer
   - user-supplied layer, user-supplied callback that sets time of the layer
     - may e.g. do nothing
   - doesn't work, would need to monkey-patch
** DONE TimedLayerClassWrapper
   CLOSED: [2014-03-14 Fri 15:04]
   - wraps an existing layer class
   - creates a new class with setTime
** DONE PreloadingTimedLayer
   CLOSED: [2014-03-17 Mon 13:54]
   - implements TimedLayer
   - instantiates layers through user-supplied factory function makeLayer(t)
     - may pre-instantiate layers
   - select layer to be displayed based on time property
** DONE RangedLayer interface
   CLOSED: [2014-03-18 Tue 17:58]
   - extension to TimedLayers
   - defines interface for setting start/end visible times for layer
** DONE RangedLayerClassWrapper
   CLOSED: [2014-03-18 Tue 17:58]
   - wraps any TimedLayer
   - visibility is be controlled by RangedLayerWrapper itself
     - intercept setVisibility calls, track both set-visibility and time-visibility, generate actual-visibility from them
     - call setVisibility on wrapped layer based on actual-visibility whenever it changes
   - time should be set by directly modifying time property of the
     layer, which it passes on to the wrapped layer, like for plain WMS
     and WMTS layers
   - start/end times vs. current time as passed through time should control visibility
** DONE Add range support to PreloadingTimedLayer
   CLOSED: [2014-03-18 Tue 17:58]
* v1.5
** DONE Add preload policy to PreloadingTimedLayer
   CLOSED: [2014-03-19 Wed 10:57]
   - only when it has grown range support
   - preload((t, steprange)) -> to-preload timesteps in-order
** DONE Add unload policy to PreloadingTimedLayer
   CLOSED: [2014-03-20 Thu 14:53]
   - retain(loaded_times, (t, range)) -> to-retain timesteps
   - added, not tested, difficult-to-test
* v2
** DONE LayerGroupCoordinator
   CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 15:40]
   - knows about user-visible layers (which are potentially groups of layers)
   - controls begin and end times passed to (Ranged) layers
   - receives updates to begin/end times of individual layers
   - receives a configuration that specifies constraints such as "B starts where A ends"
     - constraints limit overlap
   - can also pass begin and end times directly, but point is that coordinator can handle configurations like "A until it ends, then B"
* v3
** TODO Interface review
*** DONE Add getTime() to TimedLayer?
    CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 18:09]
*** DONE Add getRange() to RangedLayer?
    CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 18:09]
*** DONE Change setTimeAndRange() of RangedLayer to take range as array instead of begin and end?
    CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 18:09]
** DONE Add setRange() to RangedLayer
   CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 18:09]
** DONE What should setTime() do when the time set is outside range?
    CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 18:26]
    - now hides layer with setVisiblity() or equivalent
      - ok for now? maybe add policy alter
** DONE Need to be able to set range without touching current time
    CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 18:26]
** DONE TimedLayer and RangedLayer in wrong "package"
    CLOSED: [2014-03-24 Mon 18:27]
    - moved from OpenLayers.Layer.x to OpenLayers.Layer.Animation.x
** DONE Missing frames?? Generated URLs ok - sometimes just not shown?
   CLOSED: [2014-03-26 Wed 11:54]
   - can't find any fault in logic
   - but configuration in test HTML sometimes expects that observations are available when they are not yet / forecasts are available when they no longer are
* v3.1
** DONE Get current time range(s) from coordinator
   CLOSED: [2014-03-26 Wed 17:17]

* v3.2
** DONE Generate frame events
   CLOSED: [2014-03-26 Wed 18:51]
   - frame load start
   - frame load end
   - frame changed
* v4
** DONE Fading
   CLOSED: [2014-03-27 Thu 14:45]
   - pass fader function to TimeAwareLayerWrapper (and LayerSequenceCoordinator to enable fading between layers)
   - fader function receives old and new layer and performs fading however it pleases
     - either old or new layer may be undefined, in which case fader should just deal with the one that is defined
       - some other fader is dealing with the other layer
     - it should probably only control opacity, though
     - fader must call a fadeDone callback once it is done fading
   - control flow
     - setVisible(true) on new layer
     - pass old and new and cb to layer
     - fader does its thing over time and calls cb
     - cb does setVisible(false) on old layer

* v5
** TODO Should layer limit itself to given resolution, or should that be handled in LayerGroupCoordinator?
    - *something* should ensure that a layer shows the
      previous/next/some other time and most importantly doesn't try
      to request invalid times
      - layer should limit itself
      - need timestep.js for that

** legendinfo?
